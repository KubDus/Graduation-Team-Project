### Green Fox Academy Graduation Team Project

### Info
8 weeks project, 5 team members

We had to learn JavaSript from scratch as previous modules were in Java

We created (backend only) database of various users in organisation like GFA (students, mentors, classes, admins,...) 
We created endpoints for CRUD operations
We had various user rights for admins, mentors or students. Login was implemented.
We used SQL to store all the data.

Later on we deployed both SQL and application on MS Azure and connected them together (app is not live any more).
We implemented circle CI to autodeploy all changes done.
